## ⚠️ Heads Up

This pack has jump scares, creepy sounds, and some genuinely unsettling moments. If you're easily startled or have anxiety, maybe sit this one out—or at least turn on Streamer Mode first.

## 🎮 What's Inside

### The Basics
- **Fog that watches you** - It reacts to what you're doing
- **Things get worse over time** - Four levels of "oh no"
- **Pay attention and it notices** - The more aware you are, the more it messes with you
- **Bring friends** - Misery loves company, and so does this datapack

### For Streamers & YouTubers
- **Streamer Mode** - Get a heads up before jump scares so you don't throw your mouse
- **Adjustable intensity** - Dial it up or down depending on your audience
- **Volume settings** - Because not everyone wants their eardrums destroyed
- **Great for content** - Your chat will love watching you suffer

### The Scary Stuff
- **Something is watching** - You'll feel it before you see it
- **Mind games** - Blindness, weird sounds, that feeling you're not alone
- **Things move on their own** - Did that block just...?
- **It can hurt you** - Eventually

## 🎯 How This Thing Works

### What Makes It Notice You
- Hanging out in the dark
- Low on health
- No one else around
- Deep underground
- Bad weather, late at night

### The Four Stages
1. **Just Vibes (10-30)** - Weird sounds, uneasy feeling
2. **Getting Weird (31-60)** - Stuff moves, shadows flicker
3. **Not Great (61-85)** - You start taking damage, environment shifts
4. **Run (86-100)** - The Watcher shows up. Good luck.

### With Friends
- Fear is contagious—get close to someone scared and you'll feel it too
- More scared players = worse manifestations
- At least you'll have someone to scream with
